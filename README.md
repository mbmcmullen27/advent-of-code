    Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

    I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
    There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
    even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

    Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
    only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

    If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
    Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
    built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
    of the puzzles.

    The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
    puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
    went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
    enjoyed making it for you!

    If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.
